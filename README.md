# Toil and Trouble 2

Another game about mixing potions, from the team that brought you [Toil and Trouble](https://whatguns.itch.io/toil-and-trouble)!
This is an entry to [The Pacifist Jam](https://itch.io/jam/honest-jam-4).

## Requirements for running

- NPM
- A TypeScript compiler (`npm install --global typescript`)
- An HTTP server (`npm install --global http-server`, or another if you prefer)

## Running the game

- Start your web server serving the root of the project
- Run `tsc` to generate the JS files, or `tsc -w` to watch for changes
- Navigate to your server's IP and port in the web browser

## Pre-existing Code

Some of the code in this project was lifted from [tsg-boilerplate](https://github.com/bassguitarbill/tsg-boilerplate). This is a library of code for HTML5 / TypeScript games that we don't feel like reinventing every time we run `git init`.
